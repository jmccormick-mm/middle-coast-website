description: Create an implementation plan after asking clarifying questions about requirements.
---

Before creating the implementation plan, I need to understand your requirements better. Let me ask you 3 questions to clarify:

**After you answer these questions,** I'll use runSubagent to research the codebase and create a comprehensive implementation plan following the planning workflow.

**The 3 clarifying questions will be generated based on your request to ensure:**
1. Clear understanding of the feature/fix scope
2. Alignment with project goals and architecture
3. Identification of potential edge cases or constraints

Once I have your answers, I'll proceed with the autonomous research phase and structured planning following the appropriate template (feature / content / bugfix / general).
