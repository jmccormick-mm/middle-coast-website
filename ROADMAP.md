# Middle Coast Website - Roadmap

> From static website to intelligent cloning system

---

## CLI Workflow - Definition of Done

**Overall Goal:**

Input a reference website URL → output a production-ready Middle Coast branded website that faithfully recreates the reference structure/layout while applying Middle Coast colors, fonts, and messaging, ready to deploy and easily customizable for future changes.

**Immediate Next Feature:**

Build the agent that converts website analysis + branding rules into actual website code files.

## What We Have Now ✅

A working Middle Coast website with:

- Homepage with hero, about, investment approach, and contact sections
- Professional styling and layout
- Easy-to-edit content files
- Multiple design themes to choose from

---

## What We're Building 🚧

### The Vision

A tool that can clone any website's design and apply Middle Coast branding automatically.

**The Workflow:**

1. **Input:** Give the tool a website URL (like a competitor's site)
2. **Analysis:** Tool studies the website's structure and layout
3. **Generation:** Tool creates one Middle Coast version - same structure, our branding
4. **Deploy:** Push it live and iterate manually from there

### Why This Matters

Instead of manually recreating designs we like, the tool does it automatically. Want to match a competitor's layout? Just point the tool at their site. Need to refresh the design? Run the tool again with a new reference.

## Current Status

### ✅ Complete

- Static website infrastructure
- Content management system
- Design theme generator
- Middle Coast branding guidelines stored

### 🚧 In Progress

- Website analysis tool (can fetch and study reference sites)
- Generation engine (missing - this is the next priority)

### 📋 Not Started

- Automated deployment

## The Missing Piece

**What needs to be built next:**

The generation engine - the part that takes the analysis of a reference website and actually creates the code files for a Middle Coast branded version.

**What it does:**

- Reads the analysis of the reference site
- Applies Middle Coast colors, fonts, and messaging
- Outputs working website code
- Ensures the new site is easy to customize later

**Why it's important:**

Right now we can analyze reference websites but can't generate the actual Middle Coast version. This is the bridge between "understanding what we want" and "having a working website."

## Future Enhancements

Once the core workflow is complete:

- Asset management (automatically handle images, logos, etc.)
- Performance optimization
- Analytics integration
- Refinement of generated output quality

## How to Think About This

**Current system:** Like having a template - you fill in the blanks

**Target system:** Like having a designer - you show them examples of what you like, they create something custom for you with your branding

The difference: The AI system can work with any reference site and instantly create a branded version, then easily adapt it as needs change.
